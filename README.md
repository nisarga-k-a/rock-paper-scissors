Rock Paper Scissors Game
This project implements a Rock Paper Scissors game using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. Players can choose their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) through buttons, and the computer randomly selects its move. The game then displays the result of each round. Additionally, a command-line interface version of the game is available for those who prefer playing via the terminal. The project demonstrates basic game logic and user interaction handling in Python.
